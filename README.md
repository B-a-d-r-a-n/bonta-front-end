# Bonta E-commerce Frontend üõçÔ∏è

A hyper-modern, performant, and scalable e-commerce frontend built with **Angular 20 (Zoneless)**, **TanStack Query**, and **NgRx SignalStore**. This project serves as a blueprint for building next-generation, feature-rich web applications by combining the best of Angular's new reactive paradigm with proven state management patterns.

## üöÄ Key Highlights & Architectural Philosophy

This isn't just another e-commerce demo. Bonta is engineered from the ground up to be exceptionally performant, scalable, and a joy to develop.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Blazing Fast with Zoneless Angular:** By ditching Zone.js, we achieve fine-grained change detection and superior performance. The entire application is built on **Angular Signals**, ensuring the UI updates only when necessary.

- üß† **Intelligent State Management Strategy:** We've adopted a hybrid approach for optimal state handling:

  - **TanStack Query** masterfully handles all **server state**, eliminating complex boilerplate for data fetching, caching, and background synchronization.
  - **NgRx SignalStore** manages complex, shared **client state** (like the checkout flow or multi-faceted filters) with a simple, reactive, and boilerplate-free API.
  - **Local Component Signals** are used for simple UI state, keeping components self-contained and easy to reason about.

- üß© **Fully Standalone Architecture:** The entire application is built with **Standalone Components, Directives, and Pipes**. This modern approach simplifies the architecture, improves tree-shakability, and makes the codebase more modular and maintainable.

- üé® **Professionally Styled UI:** A combination of the rich **PrimeNG v20** component library and the utility-first power of **Tailwind CSS v4** allows for beautiful, consistent, and highly customizable user interfaces.

- ‚úÖ **Built for Scale:** The feature-based project structure ensures that as the application grows, it remains organized and easy for teams to work on concurrently.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Patterns

The architecture is designed to be robust and scalable, adhering to modern best practices.

### State Management Strategy

- **Server State (TanStack Query):** All data fetched from the API (products, orders, user profile) is managed by TanStack Query. This provides automatic caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates out of the box.
- **Shared Client State (NgRx SignalStore):** State that needs to be shared across multiple components but doesn't come from the server is handled by SignalStore. A prime example is the `CheckoutStore`, which manages the multi-step checkout process.
- **Local UI State (Angular Signals):** Any state that is local to a single component (e.g., `isLoading`, `isMenuVisible`) is managed using `signal()`, keeping components simple and self-contained.

### Component Architecture

- **100% Standalone Components:** Every component, directive, and pipe is standalone, eliminating the need for `NgModule`. This simplifies the mental model and improves code-splitting.
- **Feature-Based Module Structure:** Code is organized by business domain (e.g., `products`, `cart`, `orders`), making it easy to locate relevant files and understand the application's structure.
- **Smart vs. Presentational Components:** The application uses a mix of smart (container) components that manage state and logic, and presentational (dumb) components that are only responsible for the UI.

### Asynchronous Operations

- **Async/Await with `lastValueFrom`:** Used for simple, single-emission HTTP requests within services or mutations.
- **Observables (RxJS):** Employed for handling complex asynchronous events, such as real-time updates or debouncing user input in search fields.
